## Usage

1. Create new TODO docs in `docs/todo/` and keep items actionable/scoped.
2. Prioritize with clear phases (for example, P0/P1/P2) and explicit exit criteria.
3. When complete, move the TODO doc to `docs/todo/done/` and keep milestone/deferred context in that archived file.

## Current status

- Current TODO milestone is complete as of `2026-02-06`.
- Remaining CI-provider enforcement work is intentionally deferred and tracked inline in each TODO file.
