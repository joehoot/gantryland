# Release Guides

These guides define Gantryland release policy and coordinated release-readiness tracking.

## Guides

- [`docs/releasing/process.md`](process.md) - Release commands, bump policy, and monorepo package selection guidance.
- [`docs/releasing/0.3.0-audit.md`](0.3.0-audit.md) - Coordinated `0.3.0` release audit checklist and findings log.

## Scope boundaries

- `process.md` defines reusable release workflow and versioning policy.
- `0.3.0-audit.md` captures one release train's operational checklist and findings.

## Recommended usage order

1. Start with `process.md` for current release workflow and bump policy.
2. Use `0.3.0-audit.md` only when reviewing or continuing `0.3.0` audit context.
