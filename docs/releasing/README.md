# Release Guides

These guides define the release workflow and provenance requirements.

## Guides

- [`docs/releasing/process.md`](process.md) - Release commands, bump policy, and monorepo package selection guidance.
- [`docs/releasing/provenance.md`](provenance.md) - Release provenance requirements for signed tags and publish traceability.

Use `process.md` first, then apply `provenance.md` before tagging/publishing.
