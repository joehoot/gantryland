# Authoring Guides

These guides define Gantryland package standards for implementation, docs, and tests.

## Guides

- [`docs/authoring/package.md`](package.md) - Package design, behavior rules, and review checklist.
- [`docs/authoring/jsdoc.md`](jsdoc.md) - JSDoc structure and behavior clarity requirements.
- [`docs/authoring/readme.md`](readme.md) - Package README structure and content standards.
- [`docs/authoring/tests.md`](tests.md) - Deterministic testing patterns and coverage expectations.

## Recommended usage order

1. Start with `package.md` for behavior and API shape.
2. Use `jsdoc.md` and `readme.md` while documenting the package.
3. Use `tests.md` to verify behavior and edge-case coverage.
